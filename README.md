# UBXII-ARMA model

The scripts within this repository can be used to replicate the time series analysis of the proportion of stocked hydroelectric energy (ONS, 2019) in Southeast Brazil (Section 7).

Please use the main files "application.r" and "application_tau090.r," where you will find the instructions for execution.

The codes for fitting the beta-ARMA and KARMA models were obtained from the following repositories: https://github.com/vscher/barma, http://www.ufsm.br/bayer/boot-barma.zip, and https://github.com/fabiobayer/KARMA, respectively. You can find detailed information in the main file "application.r.
