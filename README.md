# UBXII-ARMA model

The scripts that compose this repository can be used to 
i) replicate all the results from Monte Carlo simulation presented in Ribeiro et al. (2020); (Section 5);
ii) replicate the time series analysis of the proportion of stocked hydroelectric energy (ONS, 2019) in Southeast of Brazil (Section 6).

For the simulation use the main files: "Section_5_UBXIIarma(2,2).R", "Section_5_UBXIIarma(1,1).R", "Section_5_UBXIIarma(2,1).R", and "Section_5_UBXIIarma(1,2).R".
For the application, use the main file "application.r", in which are given the instructions of execution.  

If you have questions regarding the computer code, please contact Tatiane Fontana Ribeiro at tfr1@de.ufpe.br.
